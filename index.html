      <p class="fun-text">Below is a collection of works that show my progress from newbie to...not so newbie.</p>
      <div id="project-container">
        <a id="project1" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Tribute-Page/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Tribute Page</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun1" class="fun-text">This was the very first project I did with freeCodeCamp and was also my first real website I made, after learning basic HTML. We were supposed to make a tribute page to someone, and I, of course, chose my beautiful daughter, Pearl! I experimented with almost every element I knew at that point, by including them on this site, which makes it a little busy, I know. I knew just enough CSS to change background and text colors, which, despite the simplicity, was quite a thrill to see in action. Though it looks shabby now, I am proud of it as a first step in my story.</p>
        <a id="project2" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Survey-Form/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Super Survey</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun2" class="fun-text">This survey form was the second project I did with freeCodeCamp. It was mainly a form building exercise with some light css. I decided to do a form for super powered individuals to fill out. If supers ever have to start registering their powers, the form is already in place. Your welcome, world! Anyway, as I progressed through this and started to see certain form elements behaving undesirably, I realized I had a tentative grasp on the css box model. I knew it would be a skill I would focus on with future projects.</p>
        <a id="project3" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Product-Landing-Page/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Product Page</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun3" class="fun-text">This product landing page was the third project I did with freeCodeCamp in my quest to earn their Responsive Web Design Certification. With this project, I began to have a better grasp of the css box model, learned how to make sticky headers, and experiemented with some responsive media queries. I even included some very simple JavaScript to alert the user when a product has been added to the cart. Just like a real product site! Sort of.</p>
        <a id="project4" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Technical-Documentation-Page/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Technical Page</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun4" class="fun-text">This Technical Documentation Page is the fourth project I did with freeCodeCamp. To be honest, this one was a little easy, compared to the Product Landing Page. Or maybe I was just getting more comfortable. Either way, this project was still fulfilling, in that it gave me a chance to put my loosely scrawled JavaScript notes on an official and "authoritative" internet page.</p>
        <a id="project5" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Portfolio-Rough/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Portfolio Rough</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun5" class="fun-text">This Personal Portfolio was the fifth and final project I did with freeCodeCamp, and earned me their Responsive Web Design Certification. I spent a lot of time on this one, and, though I am proud of the results, I knew I didn't want it to be my main portfolio page. You are looking at that one right now! </p>
        <a id="project6" href="https://carsontimothyblack.github.io/Breakout-Game/" target="_blank">
          <div class="project-tile">
            <div class="project-text">Breakout Game</div>
          </div>
        </a>
        <p id="fun6" class="fun-text">This Breakout Game was my swing at game development. Though I followed a tutorial on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" target="_blank">mdn</a> step by step to produce this, I still learned a lot on the way, and derived great satisfaction from the process. I have since then, done some tweeks to the code to make the game a little more "gamey". This project has launched a desire to explore other game dev tutorials and start attempting to make originals.</p>
