            I am an enthusiastic and experienced Front-end developer with a tenacious appetite to learn new technologies. It has been a long-term goal of mine to break into a professional Full Stack position, where I can truly dig into the abstract, server-side of programming. I am eager to continue developing my Front-end skills, while rigorously deepening my knowledge of Back-end technologies.
